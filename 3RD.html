		<h2>Lets Go Back In Time A Bit</h2>
		<p>To the beginning of the year, don’t remember much but I went through alot of photos to see wat was happening.
          The thought of matric was kinda scary at first, knowing that every we do this year will determine where we heading looking at the future. This time was the peak GANG TIME remember going to the kitchen almost every day.

		<p>16 Apri 2023</p>
		<p> I have actually noticed we have never actually spoken about wat happened in there.
           So what better place to talk about it then here. All I remember was waking up sounded be lights moments later was being surrounded by people I don’t know. (PS it was my parents)                                                                    
           <b>Never felt so low in my life.</b> Shid bro wen they brought u up I didn’t even know who u is. Memories were coming back really slow till I remembered to a whole day but as soon I remembered I was (No homo) Calling out u in tears. Shit I just sheared a tear just thinking about it. I literally cried for my homie like cry cry loud af kind of crying. 
            Nether less I came out stronger than ever, come out knowing my home felt just as bad. The fact u wrote on ur boots was really meant a lot. Now out I was ready to face the world with my nigga.

		<h2> GROWTH </h2>

		<p> I've been thinking a lot about this crazy year we've had, and I just wanted to shoot you a message about how damn proud and excited I am to see the awesome person you're becoming. We've had our fair share of laughs, especially about your playboy moves – classic you, keeping things interesting.
But you know what's been the real deal for me? Seeing you on this spiritual journey, getting closer to God. Man, that's some deep stuff, and it's genuinely inspiring. It's like you've found this whole new perspective on life, and it's amazing to witness.
And let's talk about your new art style – seriously, it's like you've found your groove. The pieces you're creating are not just visually striking; they're a reflection of your personal growth. It's like you've discovered this incredible way to express yourself, and I'm loving every bit of it.
Through all the ups and downs, you've been my nigga. There were moments when life got real, and you stood by me, no questions asked. Your wisdom goes beyond the playful side of you, and I've learned so much just from being around you.
Here's to you, my friend – to more growth, more laughs, and more adventures. I can't wait to see where life takes you next, and I'm just grateful to be on this journey with you. Cheers to the amazing person you are and the even more incredible person you're becoming.
